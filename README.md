📌 Problem Statement(s)
Businesses need clear insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and shipping efficiency to support data-driven decision-making. This project addresses the lack of visibility into order trends, revenue drivers, and operational performance within the Northwind dataset.

🎯 Project Objectives
- Analyze order, customer, and product data using SQL
- Identify revenue trends across time, geography, and product categories
- Evaluate shipping performance and order fulfillment efficiency
- Measure customer value and repeat purchasing behavior
- Present insights through an interactive Tableau dashboard

🛠 Tools Used in This Project
- MySQL – Data querying, joins, aggregations, and time-series analysis  
- Tableau Public – Interactive dashboards and KPI visualizations  
- GitHub – Project documentation and version control  

📊 About the Dataset
The Northwind dataset represents a fictional retail company and includes:
- Orders and order details
- Customer and employee information
- Product pricing, quantities, and discounts
- Shipping dates, freight costs, and destination countries  

The dataset is widely used for practicing real-world business analytics scenarios.

📈 Project Overview
Using MySQL, I performed exploratory, product-level, and join-based analyses to uncover trends in revenue, customer behavior, and shipping performance. These insights were then translated into an interactive Tableau dashboard to allow users to explore key metrics visually.

📊 Tableau Dashboard
The dashboard consolidates key metrics including:
- Total orders, revenue, and average order value (AOV)
- Sales trends by month, quarter, and year
- Revenue and order volume by country
- Product and employee performance metrics
- Shipping performance indicators

🗄 MySQL
SQL queries were used to:
- Aggregate revenue and quantity sold
- Calculate average order value (AOV)
- Identify top-performing customers, products, and employees
- Analyze shipping delays and freight costs
- Evaluate time-based sales trends and repeat customers

🔍 Key Insights
- Sales exhibit clear seasonal trends, with certain months and quarters driving higher revenue
- A small subset of customers and products contributes disproportionately to total sales
- Most orders are shipped on time, though late shipments present opportunities for operational improvement
- Average order value and total revenue increased over time, indicating sustained business growth
- Employee performance varies significantly in terms of revenue and quantity sold
